// string called story- we want to gather information about the indiviidual words and sentences in this string.

let story = "Last weekend I took the most beauutiful bike ride of my life.  The route is called \"The 9W to Nyack\" and it actually stretches al the wal from Riverside Park in Manhattan to South Nyack, New Jersey. It\'s really an adventure from beginning to end! It is a 48 miles loop and it bascially took me an entire day. I stopped at Riverbank State Park to take some extremely artsy photos. It was a short stop, though, because I had a really long way left to go. After a quick phot op at the very popular Little Red Light house, I began my trek across the George Washington Bridge into New Jersey. The GW is actually very long -4,740 feet! I was already very tired by the time I got to the other side. An hour later, I reached Greenbrook Nature Sanctuary, an extremely beautiful park along the coast of the Hudson. Somethhing taht was very surprising to me was that near the end of the route you actually cross back into New York! At this point, you are very close to the end.";
